# Complex Matrices

The matrices with the elements coming from the [complex number system](../Basic%20Math%20Tools/04%20Complex%20Numbers.md) are known as **Complex Matrices**.

## Inner product of Complex Vectors
Recall, in $\R^n,$ $x.y=x^Ty.$

But in $\mathbb{C},$ we cannot use the same definition.

So we define the inner product as $x.y=\bar{x}^Ty$

!!! warning

    $\bar{x}^Ty\neq\bar{y}^Tx$

## Length of a complex vector
Recall, in $\R^n,$ $||x||^2=x^Tx.$

But in $\mathbb{C}^n,$ we cannot use the same definition.

So we define the length as $||x||^2=\bar{x}^Tx$

## Conjugate Transpose ($A^*$)

For a complex matrix $A$, the conjugate transpose $A^*$ is defined as
