# Complex Numbers

A number containing the term $i$, i.e., $\sqrt{-1}$ is known as a complex number.

It is of the form $a+ib,$ where $a,b\in \R$ and $a$ is known as the **real part** and $ib$ is known as the **imaginary part**.

## Addition of Complex Numbers
Adding complex numbers gives a new complex number, whose **real part** is the sum of the real parts of the orignal complex numbers and the **imaginary part** is the sum of the imaginary parts of the orignal complex numbers.

$(a+ib) + (c+id) = (a+b) + i(b+d)$

## Multiplication in complex numbers

$(a+ib)(c+id)=a.c+i(a.d)+i(b.c)-b.d\newline\to(a+ib)(c+id)=(ac-bd)+i(ad+bc)$

## Complex Conjugate
In complex number, a term called **complex conjugate** is defined.

The complex conjugate of a complex number $a+ib$ is valued as $a-ib.$

## Length of $a+ib$

Length or distance of $a+ib$ from origin $=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$
